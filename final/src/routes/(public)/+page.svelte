            <h1 class="font-bold text-lg mb-2">Welcome to the 2025-26 Scouting year.</h1>

            <p class="mb-4">Troop 185 welcomes everyone age 11 and up to learn more about Scouting in Wellesley, MA!</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Real-world leadership development, useful life skills, epic outdoor adventures, impactful community service opportunities close to home</p>

            <p class="mb-2"><b>When:</b> Mondays from 7:30pm to 9:00pm, plus weekend outings about once a month (many of our Scouts participate in multiple sports and other activities - perfect attendance is not required or expected)</p>

            <p class="mb-2"><b>Where:</b> Parish Hall at St. Paul’s on Washington Street</p>

            <p class="mb-2"><b>Why:</b> Because it’s fun! Do you have a child who likes to go hiking, camping, kayaking, or just messing around in the outdoors... or do you think they would enjoy these things if given the opportunity in a fun and supportive environment surrounded by other like-minded kids?</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Scouting turns kids into leaders through the development of practical skills that are applied in youth-led community service projects here in Wellesley and a range of amazing outdoor adventures across New England and beyond. There is no bad time to start, and no prior experience with scouting, camping, or anything else is expected.</p>
